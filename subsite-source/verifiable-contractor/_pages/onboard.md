    </div>

2. Establish your identity
  * if you signed up before, find yourself with biometrics
  * if this is your first time, you'll need some documents, like a passport
    or driver's license.

3. Connect with a company or set up a new company
  * If you are an employee of a company using Verifiable Contractor, you
    can locate your company and tap 'request to connect'
  * If you are the first user for your company, simply tap 'set up a new company.'
    Note: you'll need some additional documentation
