## Onboarding is easy!

1. Get the app
    <div>
      <img src="./assets/images/apple-store.png" width="150px" />
      <img src="./assets/images/google-play.png" width="150px" />
    </div>

2. Establish your identity
  * if you signed up before, find yourself with biometrics
  * if this is your first time, you'll need some documents, like a passport
    or driver's license.

3. Sign the Governance Framework
  * Verifiable Contractor is an active trust network, with terms and conditions
    managed by the community, for the community.  This is like signing the
    terms and conditions and accepting the privacy policy, except that you get
    to be a part of the process.  Signing the Governance Framework enables you
    to join the community, to provide verifiable data, and to verify other's data.

4. Connect with a company or set up a new company
  * If you are an employee of a company using Verifiable Contractor, you
    can locate your company and tap 'request to connect'
  * If you are the first user for your company, simply tap 'set up a new company.'
    Note: you'll need some additional documentation
